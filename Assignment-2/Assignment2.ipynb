    "## Implement context-sensitive spelling correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement context-sensitive spelling corrector using N-gram language model. The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to implement:\n",
    "- spell-checking for a concrete language - Russian, Tatar, etc. - any one you know, such that the solution accounts for language specifics,\n",
    "- some recent (or not very recent) paper on this topic,\n",
    "- solution which takes into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings,\n",
    "- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster,\n",
    "- any other idea of yours to improve the Norvigâ€™s solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "Your project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n",
    "- Your implementation\n",
    "- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n",
    "- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement"

    "1. **N-gram dataset**: I used the COCA dataset for bigrams and fivegrams. The dataset is large and contains a lot of text data, which is important for the language model. The bigrams and fivegrams are used to calculate the probability of the word given the previous word. This is important for the context-sensitive spell correction.\n",
    "2. **Word Frequencies**: I used the top 300k words from the internet. The words with the frequency less than 700k were removed. This is done to reduce the size of the vocabulary and speed up the computations. The words with the frequency less than 700k are considered rare and are not likely to be used in the context-sensitive spell correction. The dataset was composed of Google Web Trillion Word Corpus.\n",
    "3. **Edit Frequencies**: I used the single edits frequencies from the internet. Those frequencies help me to calculate the probability of concrete sequence of edits.\n",
    "4. **Edit Distance**: I used the edit distance of 2. This is a common choice for the spell correction tasks. The edit distance of 2 allows to correct the words with two typos.\n",
    "5. **Bigram Probability**: The bigram probability is calculated as the frequency of the bigram divided by the frequency of the first word in the bigram. If the bigram is found in the dataset - it counts as correct. "
